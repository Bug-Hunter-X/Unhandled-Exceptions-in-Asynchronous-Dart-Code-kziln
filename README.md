# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous functions.  The `fetchData` function makes a network request.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, it doesn't comprehensively handle all potential failure scenarios.

**Problem:** The `catch` block simply prints the error and then rethrows it.  In a real application, this can cause crashes or unexpected behavior, especially when the app relies on the fetched data.

**Solution:** Improved error handling includes more specific error checks and a strategy for gracefully handling failures, like providing default data or displaying an error message to the user.
